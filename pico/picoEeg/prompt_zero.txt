PicoEeg is an four channel electroencephalogram simulator.
It is written in C++ with a ninja style build system.
It is based around CCRMA's Synthesis Toolkit Library.
It loops over reading stdin and is controlled in realtime.
Each line of input is a "Pico Object".
<IntegerDateInMicroseconds> TYPE Data
PicoEeg has the following states
IDLE
RUNNING
There are 4 geneartors each of which can be panned L-R
The EEG signal on each of the four channels is actually a sine wave generator.
Each channel has frequency amplitude and phase, %L and %R
Each channel should be controlled by an OSC syntax
Therefore, the input should look like this when controlling generators
<IntegerDateInMicroseconds> OSC /gen1/freq/82.5/hz
The app should use non-blocking callbacks.
All four channels should be mapped a stereo output
A kalman filter or easing function should change values from curent to target
Use OSC syntax from standard input at startup to configure audio
Default to 48000 sampling rate.
