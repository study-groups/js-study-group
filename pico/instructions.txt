### PicoObject Definition

A `PicoObject` is a structured data representation that serves as both a data entity and a message in a messaging system. Each `PicoObject` consists of the following fields:

1. **id (picoflake)**: A unique identifier for the PicoObject, generated based on the current timestamp with nanosecond precision: `$(date +%s%6N)`. This ensures that each PicoObject has a unique identifier and can be traced or referred to uniquely in the system.

2. **pid (parent picoflake)**: The picoflake of the parent PicoObject. This establishes a hierarchical or relational linkage between PicoObjects, allowing the system to understand the lineage or context of messages.

3. **topic**: A string representing the topic or category to which the PicoObject belongs. This is used for routing and filtering messages in the messaging system.

4. **type**: A string indicating the type of data or the schema that the `data` field adheres to. This helps consumers understand how to parse and process the data.

5. **data**: The actual content or payload of the PicoObject. This can be a string, structured text, or even a serialized JSON object, depending on the `type`.

6. **meta**: A field for any metadata associated with the PicoObject, such as timestamps, tags, or any other ancillary information that helps in processing or categorizing the PicoObject.

### Representation Formats

A `PicoObject` can be represented in one of three ways:

1. **Single Line (raw or tsb)**: All fields are presented in a single line with tab-separated values.
   ```
   id\ttopic\ttype\tdata\tmeta
   ```

2. **Stanza (text-based)**: Each field is presented on a new line, and PicoObjects are separated by a blank line.
   ```
   id: value
   pid: value
   topic: value
   type: value
   data: value
   meta: value
   
   ```

3. **JSON**: A standard JSON object with each field as a key-value pair.
   ```json
   {
     "id": "value",
     "pid": "value",
     "topic": "value",
     "type": "value",
     "data": "value",
     "meta": "value"
   }
   ```

### Message Storage and Notification System

Messages (PicoObjects) are stored in named pipes (FIFOs) on the Linux filesystem, and a notification system based on `inotify` is used to send messages to subscribed consumers.

#### Bash Functions

1. **Create PicoObject Pipe**:
   ```bash
   create_pico_pipe() {
       mkfifo "/path/to/pipes/$1"
   }
   ```

2. **Write to PicoObject Pipe**:
   ```bash
   write_pico_object() {
       echo "$2" > "/path/to/pipes/$1"
   }
   ```

3. **Read and Process PicoObject Pipe**:
   ```bash
   process_pico_pipe() {
       inotifywait -m "/path/to/pipes/$1" | while read pipe; do
           if read line <"/path/to/pipes/$1"; then
               process_pico_object "$line"
           fi
       done
   }
   ```

4. **Process PicoObject** (Placeholder for actual processing logic):
   ```bash
   process_pico_object() {
       # Process the PicoObject (parse, route, etc.)
       echo "Processing PicoObject: $1"
   }
   ```

#### File-based Subscription Scheme

For a file-based subscription scheme, each topic could have its own pipe, and consumers would subscribe by listening to the pipe of the topic they are interested in.

1. **Subscribe to Topic**:
   ```bash
   subscribe_to_topic() {
       process_pico_pipe "$1" &
   }
   ```

2. **Publish to Topic**:
   ```bash
   publish_to_topic() {
       write_pico_object "$1" "$2"
   }
   ```

In this scheme, `write_pico_object` writes a new PicoObject to the named pipe corresponding to the topic, and `process_pico_pipe` sets up a subscription to that pipe, processing incoming PicoObjects in real-time.

This architecture allows for real-time, topic-based messaging with a simple, filesystem-based backend, suitable for systems where the full overhead of a traditional message broker is not necessary or desired.
