Let's build PicoDb, a time-series, object orientend with functional
user semantics (map, reduce, etc) that is reactive and provides
support for automatically vectorizing the msg field which is
always considered text.

Use a minimal amount of third party code but assume we have npm
installed.

use picodb.sh to capture Bash functions for generating
file structures and example data. We want someone to be able
to git clone, cd into picodb and get started by source picodb.sh

to start, write picodb_create() that creates a server that
uses port PICODB_PORT=5100 and serves from 0.0.0.0 so
machines on a local network can see. Provide GET/examples

{
    id: 1704094517              //
    type: csvv; /* comma separated var,val */
    msg: x=222, y=333;
}

{
    id: 1704094517123456000       // date +%s%N
    type: domId.csvv; /* comma msg var,val */
    msg: domId, x=222, y=333;
}

{
    id:1704094517001            // Date.now() in JS
    type: domId.str;            // interpret msg as string
    msg: domId, "x=222, y=333";
}
