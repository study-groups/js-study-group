We are creating a cli program consisting of a collection of bash
 functions. We assume the user will source nectar.sh and nectar.sh
will source additional .sh files full of functions that 
adhere to the naming conventions nectar_topic_subtopic
and nectar_topic_subtopic would be found in ./topic.sh and 
nextar.sh would source colocated .sh files.

Begin by making nextar.sh and netar_help() which describes 
nectar are a data collection and processing system that 
runs in a terminal on the commandline.
