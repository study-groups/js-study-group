Add a bash function to /bgf/tools.sh
that replaces a bash function supplied from stdin

Add a BGF that produces a unit test framework
used to document and test Pico Object Types

Create BGFs that would be useful for the developer

Instead of functions, just put the function in
a file name that suggests what it does and
assume it will be sourced by the user but
also assume the following env variables
are set in dev.env
PORT=5001
IP=0.0.0.0
